<h2 class="project-title">
<A href="#LDAP-management">LDAP management module for Hubot</A>
</h2>

Created a management module for LDAP, using <a href="https://hubot.github.com/">Hubot robotics</a> for the <a href="https://slack.com">Slack messaging service</a>. Code snippet can be found here, although requires the full repository to work (intellectual property not owned by me). <br>
The code uses the Python LDAP module and GPG credentials for basic user management, e.g. creating and modifying users and groups.<br>
Whilst many LDAP tools already exist, this solution suited us for a number of reasons:<br>
•       Slack provides a message history, allowing us to check tasks that had been done;<br>
•       Having this functionality in our messaging service made staff onboarding easier; and<br>
•       Using encrypted credentials allowed for a more secure environment, whilst allowing more staff members to perform basic tasks.<br>
<br>
As a beginner at Python programming I found this project was very engaging, and it had a tangible and satisfying end result. I enjoyed this project so much, that I chose it for the topic of presentation for the 2016 eResearch Australasia conference. Poster design was done by our Marketing Team, and can be viewed <a href="/files/hubot_poster.pdf">here</a>

<br>

Following the success of the LDAP module, I adapted the code for another application that required user management. This code was different as it used the applications API commands for external management. <br> 
Given the time I would have liked to create many more modules for other applications, as the Hubot service was bundled with our Slack package.<br>

Before the company adopted SharePoint we were lacking a cohesive and collaborative space to record documentation on services, solutions and training materials.

Having some previous experience with Jekyll, I thought it would be the ideal platform to use in conjunction with GitHub pages..
