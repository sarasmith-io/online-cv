<h2><strong>LDAP Management module for Hubot</strong></h2>
<p>Created a management module for LDAP, using <a href="https://hubot.github.com/">Hubot robotics</a> for the <a href="https://slack.com">Slack messaging service</a>. Code snippet can be found here, although requires the full repository to work (intellectual property not owned by me).</p>
<p>The code uses the Python LDAP module and GPG credentials for basic user management, e.g. creating and modifying users and groups.</p>
<p>Whilst many LDAP tools already exist, this solution suited us for a number of reasons: &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Slack provides a message history, allowing us to check tasks that had been done;</li>
<li>Having this functionality in our messaging service made staff onboarding easier; and</li>
<li>Using encrypted credentials allowed for a more secure environment, whilst allowing more staff members to perform basic tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>This project was very engaging, as I&rsquo;m a beginner at Python programming, and had a tangible and satisfying end result. I enjoyed this project so much, that I chose it for the topic of presentation for the 2016 eResearch Australasia conference. Poster design was done by our Marketing Team, and can be viewed <a href="/files/hubot_poster.pdf">here</a>. &nbsp;</p>

Following the success of the LDAP module, I adapted the code for another application that required user management. This code was different as it used the applications API commands for external management. <br> 
Given the time I would have liked to create many more modules for other applications, as the Hubot service was bundled with our Slack package.<br>

Before the company adopted SharePoint we were lacking a cohesive and collaborative space to record documentation on services, solutions and training materials.

Having some previous experience with Jekyll, I thought it would be the ideal platform to use in conjunction with GitHub pages..
