<h2><strong>ownCloud implementation</strong></h2>
<p>In response to an increased demand for web based storage access and sharing, I configured and implemented the <a href=” https://owncloud.org/”>ownCloud</a> platform for use within the organisation.</p>
<p>There were some quirks to the implementation which required theming and LDAP authentication (using Active Directory as the source), and this project certainly helped to develop my skills in Apache, HTML, and PHP.</p>
 

<a name="LDAP-management"></a>
<h2><strong>LDAP Management module for Hubot</strong></h2>
<p>Created a management module for LDAP, using <a href="https://hubot.github.com/">Hubot robotics</a> for the <a href="https://slack.com">Slack messaging service</a>. Code snippet can be found here, although requires the full repository to work (intellectual property not owned by me).</p>
<p>The code uses the Python LDAP module and GPG credentials for basic user management, e.g. creating and modifying users and groups.</p>
<p>Whilst many LDAP tools already exist, this solution suited us for a number of reasons: &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Slack provides a message history, allowing us to check tasks that had been done;</li>
<li>Having this functionality in our messaging service made staff onboarding easier; and</li>
<li>Using encrypted credentials allowed for a more secure environment, whilst allowing more staff members to perform basic tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>This project was very engaging, as I&rsquo;m a beginner at Python programming, and had a tangible and satisfying end result. I enjoyed this project so much, that I chose it for the topic of presentation for the 2016 eResearch Australasia conference. Poster design was done by our Marketing Team, and can be viewed <a href="/files/hubot_poster.pdf">here</a>. &nbsp;</p>


<a name="CKAN-management"></a>
<h2><strong>CKAN user management module for Hubot</strong></h2>
<p>Following the success of the LDAP module, I adapted the code for another application that required user management. This code was different as it used the applications API commands for external management.</p>
<p>Given the time I would have liked to create many more modules for other applications, as the Hubot service was bundled with our Slack package.</p>


<a name="Puppet-overhaul"></a>
<h2><strong>Puppet overhaul for HPC cluster management</strong></h2>
<p>One of my challenges at my past employment was to assess and redesign the configuration management for the HPC cluster. The system was using <a href=” https://puppet.com/”>Puppet</a> and <a href=” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickstart_(Linux)”>Kickstart</a> to manage system files and reinstallation, but with multiple collaborators and no version control had become unwieldly.</p>
<p>I was able to create a new Puppet repository, using GitHub for version control, and utilised Puppet’s recommended roles and profiles as well as <a href=” https://puppet.com/docs/hiera/3.3/puppet.html”>Hiera data</a> to allow for dynamic values such as IP addresses and zoning configuration. The new solution kept Kickstart as the method of rebuilding nodes as required, and through a Puppet autosign configuration rebuilds were achieved from a single command prompt. </p> 
<p>This project, although large, was very rewarding as I have a natural penchant for organisation and lists, which is well suited to configuration management.</p>

<h2><strong>Technical Documentation wiki</strong></h2>

<p>Before the company adopted SharePoint we were lacking a cohesive and collaborative space to record documentation on services, solutions and training materials.</p>

<h2><strong>Resume Website</strong></h2>

<p>Having some previous experience with Jekyll, I thought it would be the ideal platform to use in conjunction with GitHub pages.</p>
